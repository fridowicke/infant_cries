This repository contains the Notebooks I use for my Bachelor's Thesis "Data Driven Methods for Analyzing the Frequency Spectrum of Infant Cries"

# Information about the Data
The Notebooks in this Repository work on the Data, that was provided by Prof. Kathleen Wermke.
As of now, the dataset isn't published yet, so the Code needs to be run with other data for those who don't have acces to the dataset.

If you have any questions about or problems with the code, or would like to ask about the data, please email me:
